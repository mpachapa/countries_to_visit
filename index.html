      <p>
        I want to go to Germany because I studied the languange in high school
        and I never had the chance to speak the language. I really enjoyed
        learning about their culture and I enjoy drinking German style beers.
        Some of the cities I would like to visit include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Munich</li>
        <li>Frankfurt</li>
        <li>Cologne</li>
        <li>Hamburg</li>
        <li>Berlin</li>
      </ul>

      <header id="">United Kingdom</header>
      <p>
        I would also love to visit the United Kingdom in the spring time. I
        would travel to London, and then to Manchester, and then to the Isle of
        Man.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I'm in the country I would also go and visit Scotland and visit
        the cities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. I would checkout the Cairngorms
        National Park that is just North of both of these cities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then on my way back to London I would go west and checkout some smaller
        cities in Wales. Seeing Cardiff Castle has always been something that I
        wanted to do since playing the peice by Mark Williams in middle school.

      <header id="">Japan</header>
      <p>
        Japan has always interested me and since it is an island nation it has
        been isolated throughout the centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        I woud love to travel around Japan by rail because they have a
        sophisticated high speed rail system that goes across majority of the
        country. They also have a railpass that is a joint venture between six
        companies that allows for you to tavel around the country by train!

      <header id="">Netherlands</header>
      <p>
        The Netherlands is another country in Europe that I would love to visit
        beacuase they have a lot of interesting public infrastucure that has
        been built in the past several decades. I would love to sightsee all the places throughout Amsterdam
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most interesting public infrastucure projects is called the
        Delta Works, which is a series of dykes, levees, and dams that were
        constructed after the 1953 disater. This was a major flood disaster in
        the North Sea causing damage throughout the Netherlands, Belgium,
        Scotland, and England.

      <p>
        I really want to visit Italy because of their amazing food culture. I
        would love to visit Rome, Naples, and the Italian Riviera, which
        countains a few UNESCO World Heritage sites.
      </p>
      <img src="img/italianRiviera.jpg" alt="Italian Riviera">
      <p>
        Italy also has a lot World Heritage sites that have stood the test of
        time.

      <h3>Example 1: Some JS Template Literals</h3>
      <code>
        let string = "Hello World"; <br />
        console.log(`This is what is contained within the string variable:
        ${string}`); <br />//Expected output: "This is what is contained within
        the string variable: Hello World" <br />
      </code>
      <h3>Example 2: Some Loop Examples</h3>
      <code>
        let array = ["Hello","My","Name","is","Matthew"] <br />
        for(var i = 0; i < array.length; i++){ <br />
        &ensp;console.log(array[i]); <br />
        } <br> //Expected output, each one on a new line: Hello, My, Name, is,
        Matthew
        <br />
        <br />
        var j = 10; <br />
        while(j > 0){<br />
        &ensp;console.log(j);<br />
        &ensp;j--;<br />
        } <br>//Expected output, each one on a new line: 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1
      </code>
      <h3>Example 3: An If Statements Example</h3>
      <code>
        var holiday = false; <br />
        var weekend = !true; <br />
        var time = 15; <br />
        <br />
        if (holiday == true || weekend == true) {
        <br />&ensp;console.log("closed");<br />
        } else if (8 < time && time < 18) { <br />
        &ensp;console.log("open"); <br />} else
        <br />&ensp;console.log("closed"); <br />} <br>//Expected output: "open"
      </code>
      <h3>Example 4: A Switch Example</h3>
      <code>
        const expr = 'Sour Patch';<br />
        switch (expr) {<br />
        &ensp;case 'Kit Kat': <br />

        <br>//Expected output: "Sour Patch Kids are $1.99"
      </code>
      <h3>Example 5: Higher Order Function</h3>
      <code>
        function add(number1, number2) { <br />
        &ensp;return number1 + number2;<br />
        }<br />

        &ensp;return operation(number1,number2);<br />
        }<br />
        <br />
        console.log(doMath(add, 2, 5)); //Expected output: 7<br />
